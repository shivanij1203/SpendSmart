- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **SQLite** (Database)
- **HTML/CSS** (Frontend)
- **JavaScript** (Dynamic Elements)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- **Django Rest Framework** (For potential API development)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone (https://github.com/gauravdev01/Expense-Tracker)
cd expense-tracker
```
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. You can create one by running:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Mac/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Set Up the Database
Run the migrations to set up the database:
Python Expense Tracker Output:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
### 5. Create a Superuser (for Admin Access)
If you want to access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

### 6. Run the Development Server
Start the development server to run the application:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The application should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

**Usage**

**Accessing the Application:** Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser to start using the expense tracker.

**Admin Panel:** Access the Django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ using the superuser credentials created earlier.
